# DaBabyBot
a simple discord bot that sends dababy lyrics

Here's the link to add DaBabyBot to your server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=827754582209462283&permissions=8&scope=bot

This bot isn't deployed, however; you'll have to run it yourself. I would run a cell in Colab before putting the code on GitHub. Now that it's here, you can open this repo in Gitpod and run 'python main.py'
